    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 24.12.2025</p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the <strong>ARBAT</strong> mobile application (“ARBAT”) handles user information.</p>
        <p>The App is a simple WebView application that displays the website <a href="https://arbat.mag1c.ru" target="_blank">arbat.mag1c.ru</a>, which allows users to order goods from local markets in the small village Palazna nearby city Perm.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
        <p>The App itself does not collect, store, or share any personal information.</p>
        <p>However, when using the App, users interact with the website displayed inside the App. Any information entered (such as name, phone number, or order details) is collected and processed directly by the website, not by the App.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. WebView & Website Data</h2>
        <p>The website loaded inside the App may collect certain information, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information users voluntarily provide (e.g., order details)</li>
            <li>Cookies or similar technologies</li>
            <li>Technical information like IP address or browser data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please refer to the website’s own privacy practices for more details: <a href="https://arbat.mag1c.ru/applications/Store?state=home" target="_blank">Website Privacy Practices</a></p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App itself does not use analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.</p>
        <p>Any third-party services used (such as payment providers or analytics) are part of the website and are governed by their respective privacy policies.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and it does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since the App does not collect or store personal data, it does not retain user information on its own servers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.</p>
